Hello!

This is a repo to hold all the implementations of Eertree that we have/had... Each will be slightly different, and will clearify that in the name of the branches, where the code will be stored. 
This was a result of the Term paper for the Algorithms course at Appalachian State Univerisy.

Team: Abdel Issa, Brady Adcock, Luke Patterson, Hayden Fravel
