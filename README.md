# EERTREE

An exploration and implementation of palindromic treesâ€™, EERTREEs', whose construction is linear space. This structure provides fast access to all subpalindromes of a string or set of strings. Some applications include palindromic factorization problems, rich string enumeration, and identification of WatsonCrick (WK) palindromes.
